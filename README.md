# Motivation

# Partners of Project
We collaborated with [Atlanta Regional Commission](https://atlantaregional.org/) for this project. Atlanta Regional Commission is the regional planning and intergovernmental coordination agency for the Atlanta region that works with partners that works across the community to plan for a brighter tomorrow. 

For this project, Atlanta Regional Commission has provided us guidelines, daily census tract-level eviction filing count data for the ARCâ€™s 5-county region from 1/1/2019 to 2/3/2022, and feedback to our dashboard to convey a more accurate representation of the eviction filings in Atlanta.
